**Title:** I built a Kodi plugin for Cisco Live on-demand sessions

**Body:**

Been wanting to watch Cisco Live sessions from the couch instead of hunched over a laptop. Couldn't find anything that worked well, so I built a Kodi plugin for it.

**What it does:**
- Browse all Cisco Live on-demand sessions (2018-2026) by event, technology, or skill level
- Search across the entire catalog (6500+ sessions from 12 events)
- Filter by technology area and technical level
- Watch history tracking
- Sign in via QR code on your phone

Works on any Kodi 21+ device (Fire TV, Shield, PC, Mac, RPi, etc.)

**GitHub:** https://github.com/martap79/plugin.video.ciscolive

It's been submitted for inclusion in the official Kodi add-on repository (PR pending review). In the meantime you can install it manually from the repo.

You'll need a free Cisco account (the same one you'd use on ciscolive.com). No paid subscriptions or anything like that.

Happy to hear feedback or feature requests.

Built a Kodi plugin that gives you access to the full Cisco Live on-demand library. All events from 2018 through 2026, searchable and filterable right from your remote.

If you've ever wanted to binge breakout sessions on a Friday night (no judgment), this makes it pretty easy.

**Features:**
- Full catalog: 6500+ sessions across 12 events
- Browse by event, technology, skill level
- Search with filters
- Watch history so you can pick up where you left off
- QR code login from your phone

**GitHub:** https://github.com/martap79/plugin.video.ciscolive

Submitted for the official Kodi add-on repo, waiting on review. Manual install works fine in the meantime.

Requires a free Cisco account (same as ciscolive.com). Runs on Kodi 21+ on any platform.

**Title:** Made a Kodi plugin for Cisco Live on-demand sessions - great for lab study

**Body:**

If you run Kodi on your homelab media setup and you're into networking/infrastructure, I built a plugin that lets you browse and watch the entire Cisco Live on-demand library from your TV.

6500+ sessions from 2018-2026 covering security, enterprise networking, data center, collaboration, the works. Filter by technology and skill level, search across events, and it tracks your watch history.

Pretty handy if you're studying for certs or just want to throw on a deep dive session while you're racking gear.

**GitHub:** https://github.com/martap79/plugin.video.ciscolive

Pending approval for the official Kodi repo. Manual install in the meantime. Free Cisco account required (same as ciscolive.com). Kodi 21+.

**Title:** Kodi add-on for Cisco Live on-demand video library

**Body:**

Hi all,

I've built a Kodi add-on that provides access to the full Cisco Live on-demand session library directly from Kodi. It covers all events from 2018 through 2026.

Features include browsing by event, filtering by technology area and technical level, full-text search, and watch history tracking. Authentication uses your existing Cisco account via QR code sign-in.

The source is available on GitHub: https://github.com/martap79/plugin.video.ciscolive

It's been submitted for inclusion in the official Kodi add-on repository. Manual installation is available now for anyone who wants to try it.

Requires Kodi 21 (Omega) or newer. Feedback and suggestions are welcome.

**Title:** Kodi plugin for watching Cisco Live sessions on your TV

**Body:**

For anyone using Cisco Live on-demand sessions as study material, I built a Kodi plugin that makes the full library available on any TV or media device.

You can browse all events (2018-2026), filter by technology and difficulty level, and search across 6500+ sessions. It also tracks what you've watched so you can pick up where you left off.

Useful if you prefer watching sessions on a bigger screen while taking notes, or just want a better browsing experience than the website.

**GitHub:** https://github.com/martap79/plugin.video.ciscolive

Currently pending review for the official Kodi add-on repository. Manual install available now. Requires a free Cisco account and Kodi 21+.
